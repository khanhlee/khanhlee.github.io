# About Me
* I am currently an Associate Professor with the Professional Master Program in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, College of Medicine, [Taipei Medical University (TMU)](https://aiim.tmu.edu.tw), Taiwan. I am also a joint Associate Professor with the International Master/PhD Program in Medicine (IGPM-TMU), International Ph.D. Program for Cell Therapy and Regeneration Medicine (IPCTRM-TMU) and TMU Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.
* Prior to joining TMU, I was a Research Fellow at the Medical Humanities Research Cluster, School of Humanities, [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](http://www.ntu.edu.sg), Singapore. I received my MS and PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate Program in Biomedical Informatics, [Yuan Ze University (YZU)](https://www.yzu.edu.tw/), Taiwan.
